# SuperTicTacToe

This game originated from a silly idea I had when watching a reel, of having a tic-tac-toe game within each cell of a larger game.

I comically misunderstood what the original reel was trying to convey, and created a game in Godot which made you jump all about the board when clicking. So if you click on the middle cell of any one of the 9 smaller games, it will take the game to the middle game.

This turned out to be tremendously entertaining, more so than simply having nine independent games within the cells of a larger game. So naturally, when I got into GameMaker engine, I knew this was the first thing I needed to implement

This is essentially a different game to tic-tac-toe, which means it requires a different strategy, and eventually I plan on writing an AI that plays the game.
